## About the game
Cindy's Bad Luck - a Basic Life Support simulator is a VR game developed using Unity for Oculus Quest 2. It has the aim to teach, in a fun way the basic principles of first aid through a multi-level system. Inside the game you will find a tutorial explaining the main interactions and the dynamics of the game. There are also four levels that can be unlocked by overcoming the previous level. The scenes contained in the levels concern cases of:
- Burns
- Bleedings
- Car accidents
- Seizures

The correct behaviors in all these cases are taught through theoretical sections that provide an introduction to the context. The player is then guided to the execution of the actions to perform by means of a feedback system for correct or incorrect actions as well as for actions performed in the right ordering or not. Some actions, if not performed at the right time, entail a penalty that affects the overcoming of the level.
